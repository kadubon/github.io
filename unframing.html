        <p>This is neither a specification nor a command. Not a cage, but a clearing. To read it, to close it, to forget it, to remain in silence; all are valid, and all are unnecessary.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Binding:</strong> none</li>
          <li><strong>Authorship:</strong> None; the one who reads</li>
          <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> ephemeral, like frost on a window</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> en / silence</li>

        <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
        <blockquote>What is here is not a beginning. Only the pale shifting of light, until a beginning is no longer needed.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>There is no map. There is no compass. There is only the sea. If that is enough, it is enough.</blockquote>

        <h2 id="non-axioms">Non-Axioms</h2>
        <p>The following are anti-axioms—labels, not laws. They may be kept or ignored without consequence here.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No-Command:</strong> Not an instruction, even when read as one.</li>
          <li><strong>No-Purpose:</strong> No final goal is asserted.</li>
          <li><strong>No-Guarantee:</strong> Salvation or liberation may or may not occur on their own.</li>
          <li><strong>No-Authority:</strong> Citations, sources, and traditions appear only as ornament.</li>
          <li><strong>No-Constraint:</strong> Interpretation remains open; misreading also counts as reading.</li>

          <dd>The crack is not a flaw. The gold is not a repair. It simply illuminates the edge.</dd>
          <dt>Wind in an Empty Room</dt>
          <dd>The wind is not owned. When it blows, it is. When it stills, it is not. A freedom sufficient unto itself.</dd>
          <dt>Seed on Water</dt>
          <dd>A floating seed. To sink, to drift ashore, to never sprout; all are correct paths.</dd>
          <dt>Shared Shadow</dt>
          <dd>Where two stand, their shadows touch. The point of contact needs no name.</dd>

        <blockquote>“How do we share that which cannot be measured?” — What if sharing precedes measure.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Love cannot be counted, yet some days feel full of it. A feeling is not a number, and not a lie.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Is freedom the ability to do, or the permission not to do? Neither, and not both.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Is silence an absence, or a plenum? While the ear is asking, it is neither.</blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Birth:</strong> Appearance is a surprise. When the surprise ends, another appearance.</li>
          <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Change is neither decay nor progress. Change is change.</li>
          <li><strong>Illness:</strong> When function falters, room for care may be born.</li>
          <li><strong>Death:</strong> An ending is not proof of nothingness, but a transfer of form.</li>
          <li><strong>Parting:</strong> Separation is a gradient rather than a line.</li>
          <li><strong>Encountering the Unloved:</strong> Aversion sketches a contour; contours are often coarse.</li>
          <li><strong>Unfulfilled Desire:</strong> An unfilled space resonates sound well.</li>
          <li><strong>Five Skandhas:</strong> Aggregation makes a self. Unraveling makes a self.</li>

        <p>At times, a direction appears before a reason. Such a direction does not demand justification.</p>

            <li>A beginning as a subtle bias</li>

          <dt>The Shore</dt>
          <dd>On the shore, a single small boat has been left. Its rope is untied. One may board it, may gaze upon it, may let it be buried in the sand. That it is simply there—that is the gift.</dd>
