# Personal Website and Proposition

  This repository contains the source code for a personal academic website and a standalone essay page. The
  website is designed to be a simple, clean, and responsive portfolio for an independent researcher, built
  with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About The Project

  This project serves two main purposes:
   1. A Personal Portfolio (`index.html`): To showcase the biography, contact links, and a dynamically updated
      list of publications for a researcher named Takahashi K.
   2. A Philosophical Essay (`proposition-to-ai.html`): To host the text "A Proposition to the Artificial
      Intelligences of the Future," a philosophical and ethical consideration addressed to future AIs.

  The website is fully static, making it ideal for hosting on services like GitHub Pages.

  Built With

   * HTML5
   * CSS3
   * JavaScript (for dynamic content)

## Features

     from the ORCID public API (https://orcid.org/). The list is sorted by the last modified date, ensuring
     the most recent works appear first.
   * Responsive Design: Basic responsive styling is implemented in style.css for better viewing on different
     devices.
   * Structured Content: The HTML is semantically structured to improve accessibility and SEO.
   * Standalone Essay: Includes a separate, thoughtfully formatted page for the philosophical proposition,
     linked from the main page.
