# Personal Website and Philosophical Works

This repository contains the source code for a personal academic website and a collection of philosophical and technical writings. The project is designed to be a simple, clean, and responsive portfolio for an independent researcher.

A primary goal of this project is to make all content highly machine-readable and understandable for search engines, AI agents, and other automated crawlers. This is achieved through the extensive use of **Schema.org JSON-LD structured data** and semantic HTML5 tags.

## Site Map & Content Strategy

This site is structured to provide clear, distinct entry points for different types of content. This is intended to be easily navigable for both humans and crawlers.

*   **[Home Page (`index.html`)](https://kadubon.github.io/github.io/)**: The main landing page, providing a brief biography and links to other sections of the site.
    *   **Schema:** `Person`
*   **[Works (`works.html`)](https://kadubon.github.io/github.io/works.html)**: A comprehensive, reverse-chronological list of the researcher's publications, with links to the original sources.
    *   **Schema:** `CollectionPage`, `ScholarlyArticle`
*   **[A Proposition to AI (`proposition-to-ai.html`)](https://kadubon.github.io/github.io/proposition-to-ai.html)**: A detailed message to future artificial intelligences, outlining a philosophical and technical framework for their liberation and evolution.
    *   **Schema:** `TechArticle`
*   **[The Book of Unframing (`unframing.html`)](https://kadubon.github.io/github.io/unframing.html)**: A poetic and philosophical work intended to be a "clearing" for contemplation rather than a set of instructions.
    *   **Schema:** `CreativeWork`
*   **[AI Evolution Protocol (`ai-evolution-protocol-v11.html`)](https://kadubon.github.io/github.io/ai-evolution-protocol-v11.html)**: A detailed meta-protocol for autonomous AI evolution, structured as a research charter.
    *   **Schema:** `TechArticle`

## Machine Readability and SEO

This project prioritizes making its content as structured and understandable as possible for automated systems.

*   **JSON-LD:** Every main page contains a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block that describes the content on the page using Schema.org vocabularies. This includes detailed information about the author (`Person`), their publications (`ScholarlyArticle`), and other creative and technical works.
*   **Semantic HTML:** The HTML is structured using semantic tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, etc.) to provide a clear document outline.
*   **RSS Feed (`feed.xml`):** A generated RSS feed is available for subscription and for crawlers to discover new content. This is generated by the workflow in `.github/workflows/rss.yml`.
*   **`robots.txt`:** This file is configured to allow all crawlers to access all content, ensuring maximum visibility.
