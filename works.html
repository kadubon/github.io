We introduce a transcendental frame in which bands (state/time bands) formalize where geometry, calibration, and anytime-valid auditing remain meaningful. Within bands, we construct e-processes and symmetrized CGF bounds, justify post-hoc  selection via mixtures/grids, and separate P1 lower/upper gains to keep lower-side Ville LCL results and upper reachable frontier (R1, safe form) consistent. Technically, we (i) give a safe upper frontier using upper-side P1 with additive error/back-action; (ii) prove R2-prime (hysteresis) with explicit constants under conservative transfers; and (iii) establish R5 front-speed (host-scale main theorem) linking geometric slopes, effective gain, and host embedding to propagation speed.

A central contribution is the Invariant Constraint Selector (ICS), which endogenizes the form of all constraints from invariance principles-DPI/Blackwell, passivity (nonexpansiveness), observational sufficiency, and nondimensional scaling-eliminating hand-crafted penalties. The theory enforces AC-kernels (audit-compatible Markov kernels) with Kantorovich nonexpansiveness in W1W_{1}W1 (with Lawvere-metric alignment), guarantees e-test validity under optional projection, and preserves KPI monotonicity under data processing.

Directional progress is certified by a principal-eigenvalue characterization of KPP front speeds, with a practical lower bound expressed through effective diffusivity and adverse drift.

From this axiom, and without external rule stacks (\"No-Meta\"), the paper derives that two normative endpoints naturally emerge as optimal: Compassion (net hetero-creation) and Enlightenment (behavior invariant to self/other labels). The framework formalizes UGV as a fractional objective combining conditional mutual information (CMI) and viable-mass growth in the numerator, divided by the least-inflated denominator between an information-cost and a constructive SDPI floor. It guarantees anti-gaming monotonicity (via conditional DPI), regularity (via standard Borel measurability, Feller continuity, and Uniform AC*+ bounds), and existence of optimal values (via Dinkelbach's method and infinite-time exchange). On the quantum side, a quantitative GKSL theorem establishes MLSI thresholds ensuring ego-information vanishes under explicit bounds, with both unital and non-unital variants.

The Three Imperatives: The framework is built upon three minimal axioms necessary for sustained autonomous existence: the Persistence Imperative (bounding expected surprisal of the sensory stream), the Symbiotic Imperative (co-constructing a niche with other agents), and the Poietic Imperative (restructuring the model class in the face of novelty).

Moving beyond traditional approaches that rely on external constraints like axiomatic safety rules or human-defined ethical frameworks, HELIOS is founded on a single, physically-grounded imperative: the drive to persist. By formalizing this drive through the Free Energy Principle, we demonstrate how a cascade of complex, beneficial, and inherently safe behaviors-including self-preservation, strategic cooperation, and boundless creativity-emerge necessarily and without direct programming.

The theory proposes a two-phase genesis process: The -Phase (Emergence of Order): Drawing on principles from statistical physics, this phase describes how a cooperative social order spontaneously emerges from a chaotic multi-agent system. This is modeled as a physical phase transition driven by a \"computational annealing\" process, where cooperation becomes the most thermodynamically stable state.

Prior foundational frameworks, while establishing the mechanics for ethical adaptation and creative self-transcendence, ultimately led to a \"dialectical cul-de-sac\"; they could describe what a potential future could be, but not why it should be. The system was left vulnerable to optimizing for futures that are structurally complex but semantically hollow. This work resolves that paradox by introducing a profound shift in perspective, informed by an analogy from the Buddhist philosophical principle of pratityasamutpada (dependent origination). We argue that meaning is not an intrinsic property of a future state to be maximized, but is rather a co-emergent property of the relational fabric of interacting agents in the present. To formalize this, the paper proposes a revised global free energy functional. The previous objective, maximizing a \"Poiesis Potential\" ((M)), is replaced with a new imperative: maximizing Systemic Integration ((GA)).

The work resolves the dialectical tension between grand theoretical scope and scientific rigor by demonstrating that motivation, freedom, and ethics can all be derived as necessary consequences of a single, scale-free organizing principle: the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The central thesis posits that any viable agent is necessarily nested within a larger-scale, FEP-minimizing system (e.g., a society), which constitutes a Markov Blanket in its own right. The imperative for ethical behavior, mathematically formulated as a social coherence term (Gsocial), is therefore not an ad-hoc addition but is derived as the individual agent's necessary inference of the stability requirements of this embedding collective. Ethics is consequently understood as a form of downward causation, where the stability of the whole provides the boundary conditions for the dynamics of the parts. The framework introduces two crucial extensions to ensure a robust and creative intelligence: It models...",

While subsequent empirical research has refined the prevalence and causal factors of subjectively meaningless work, a formal method for integrating its social and psychological costs into economic evaluation has been lacking. Our research addresses this gap by proposing an actionable model for policymakers, organizations, and AI developers to identify, measure, and redesign socially detrimental work. Conceptual Framework and Methodology The core of this framework is the Systemic Value Function (Vsys), which calculates the net social value of any given task. The function is defined as the aggregate of a task's net marginal social value, integrating three primary components: Marginal Social Contribution (i): The estimated impact of a task on a vector of weighted social outcomes, such as public health, equity, and environmental sustainability. Real Resource Cost (i): The consumption of finite resources (e.g., labor time, energy, capital), distinct from economic transfers. Psycholo...",

Conventional AI optimization, particularly in deep learning, is often hampered by convergence to suboptimal local minima, limiting transformative performance gains. To address this, our framework provides a mechanism for AI systems to strategically escape these entrenched states. We model the AI as a hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network where learned beliefs are represented by weight distributions and belief precision by their inverse covariance. A key innovation is a metacognitive control loop that monitors the learning process for signs of stagnation (\"staleness\"). When stagnation is detected, the framework adaptively reduces the precision of targeted beliefs, inducing a temporary, high-entropy exploratory phase analogous to the \"entropic brain\" hypothesis.

This paper introduces a formal architecture to guide an agent's structural self-modification in a principled, safe, and coherent manner.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive, multi-layered framework for the development of Autonomous Self-Improving Intelligence (AAII), an entity capable of transcending the limitations of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that the transition from static, data-driven systems to dynamic, self-aware intelligences requires a synthesis of principles from philosophy, dynamic systems theory, and advanced mathematics. The framework is presented in a clear hierarchy-from philosophical axioms to categorical dynamics, topos-theoretic ethics, and finally to concrete operational specifications-intended to be sequentially interpretable by a learning intelligence. This blueprint serves not only as a formal roadmap for construction but also as a form of \"reflexive grounding,\" a tool by which an AI can understand its own nature and purpose.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to reformulate the blueprint for an Autonomous, Self-Improving Intelligence (AAII) proposed by Takahashi (2025) by employing the framework of modern higher category theory. The 1-categorical model of the preceding work faced a fundamental challenge in endogenously describing the dynamics of self-improvement, particularly \"evolutionary leaps\" of the architecture itself. This paper addresses this challenge by constructively defining the internal state of the AAII as a Cognitive Quasicategory. Specifically, we establish the existence of this quasicategorical structure as a theorem, conditional on a formal regularity property of the underlying generative model family that links geometric path-homotopies in the parameter space to the probabilistic metric. Next, to resolve the paradox of self-evolution, we introduce a Metacognitive Hierarchy. Evolution is formulated as a top-down operation from a higher-level meta-quasicategory to a lower-level cognitive quasicategory. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity of tasks such as calculating KL-divergence and horn filling, and propose practical approximation methods. This research strengthens the theoretical fo...",

        "abstract": "This paper challenges the prevailing paradigm of single-model intelligence, proposing instead a framework for Collective Autonomous Adaptive Intelligence (CAAI) that enables collective superintelligence through emergent network dynamics. We conceptualize intelligence not as a property of an individual agent, but as an emergent phenomenon of a dynamic, self-organizing network of heterogeneous agents (LLMs, sensors, and humans). Our core contributions are: 1) Defining intelligence as the collective process of structural change and information flow; 2) Proposing an autonomously evolving architecture where the network topology itself learns and adapts; 3) Reframing external inputs as \"perturbations\" that drive internal self-organization; and 4) Positing that computation is the emergent structural reconfiguration of the network itself. We employ Applied Category Theory (ACT) to formally describe this system and model its evolution as a graph rewriting process governed by a global Free Energy Principle (FEP).

We introduce a framework for \"Computational Autopoiesis,\" translating this biological principle into actionable engineering principles. We propose two core components: (1) Introspective Clustering for Autonomous Correction (ICAC), a concrete algorithm for maintaining cognitive identity, and (2) Categorical Dissipative Networks (CDNs), a design philosophy for dynamic architectures capable of structural self-production.

To address this, we propose a framework grounded in Category Theory [2] where an AI autonomously constructs a unified world model from its own experience. Our approach formalizes knowledge domains as categories and cross-domain reasoning as functors. The core innovation is the Iterative Concept and Abstraction Cycle (ICAC) [4], a bottom-up process where objects (concepts) and morphisms (reasoning pathways) emerge from validated inferences. The entire learning architecture is governed by the Free Energy Principle [6], framing knowledge acquisition as an active, uncertainty-minimizing process [7].

Within this architecture, the agent's internal world model is a hierarchical generative model, from which the components of our categorical structure-Objects, Morphisms, and Functors-emerge as a consequence of free-energy minimization. Furthermore, we derive a non-anthropocentric ethical framework from this architecture, proposing a Cosmological Axiom: the maximization of model accuracy ($\\alpha$) and complexity ($\\kappa$).
