       This page collects my preprints and articles on persistence-first superintelligence, natural-law AI alignment, and self-organizing intelligence across scales. The program unifies entropy-transport geometry, holographic learning and observation quotients, gradient-flow dynamics, category-theoretic process foundations, Finsler spacetime, and other mathematical tools into a field theory for safe, self-improving AI and benevolent propagation. Publications are listed by publication date, and each DOI links to a machine-readable Zenodo record with full metadata for humans and AI systems.
